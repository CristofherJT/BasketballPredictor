NBA Point Predictor

-Summary
This project predicts the points scored by NBA players in upcoming games using player performance data and mathcups. It integrates data from multiple NBA seasons and uses machine learning models to make predictions with the given data. 

-Current
Currently I am still working on the project when possible. The program can make predictions, but at times can be inaccurate. I plan to improve the model by training it and to take the matchup into consideration.
